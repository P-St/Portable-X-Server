# Portable X-Server
A minimal X Window System for Windows 7+

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal X Window System which will run out of the box on any Windows 7+ system. To realize this, all files that aren't needed for basic functionality are removed from a suitable installation package from the project VcXsrv Windows X Server (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and archived to a .zip file.

Portable X-Server also integrates seamlessly into WinSSHTerm, a tabbed SSH solution for Windows:
